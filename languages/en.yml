Some are more affected than others, but the most affected, for example **C** and **C++** courses, have aged horribly. They give bad habits, make people use things that are sometimes depreciated and should no longer be used, as new features have been added as replacements.\nI'm not going to detail the problems of each obsolete course here, that would be too long.\n\nJust keep in mind that you should **beware** of the programming courses available on this site. If possible, ask for advice from people who are informed about the course you plan to take, to make sure it's not a bad idea. The Openclassrooms forums are open, many discord servers about computing exist, you should find answers to your questions."
