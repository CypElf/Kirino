## Presentation

Kirino is a multi languages, IT / programming oriented discord bot.

She brings some programming functionnalities such as :
- a lot of guide's links to learn **programming** in a given language properly
- numeric base **conversion**
- **base64, ascii and rot13** encoding and decoding
- **md5** hashing
- search though **Rust**'s documentation
- **GitHub** profile search

But also some useful general commands :
- the capability to set **rules** for a server and display the one wanted at any time
- a banword system to **block** certain words from your server
- an afk system to leave a message to those who would mention you while you're away

And lots of others more classic commands : ban, kick, purge, serverinfo, userinfo, roleinfo, avatar...
